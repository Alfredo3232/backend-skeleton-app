# full-stack-skeleton-app

This will be a template for me to use on my full-stack applications, this repository will basically be a starter for new applications, feel free to use it for your own apps as well.

## Eslint Configuration

I will not include one eslint config file. This is for many reasons one being that eslint has many configurations for installing,
for example if you install eslint globally, ```npm install -g eslint```, and you run the command in a project it will give you tons of
options to configure your eslint according to what technologies you will be using in your application.

So instead I included docs for vue and regular javascript eslint and .vscode settings:\
[vue-docs](./docs/vue-settings/README.md)\
[js-docs](./docs/js-settings/README.md)
