# backend-skeleton-app

This will be a template for me to use on my full-stack applications, this repository will basically be a starter for new applications, feel free to use it for your own apps as well.

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Starting the Server

```sh
npm run start
```

### Lint with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)

```sh
npm run lint
```

## Eslint Configuration

I included a eslint config, but you may need to re-configure it. This is for many reasons one being that eslint has many configurations for installing,
for example if you install eslint globally, ```npm install -g eslint```, and you run the command,```eslint --init```, in a project it will give you tons of
options to configure your eslint according to what technologies you will be using in your application.
